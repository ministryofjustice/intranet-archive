## Workflow

Archiving the Intranet, thankfully, is a task made simple using the following technologies:

1. Cloud Platform
2. AWS S3
3. AWS CloudFront
4. HTTrack Cli
5. NodeJS Server

## Viewing the latest snapshot

Access is granted to the snapshot if, you:

1) Have access to the [MoJ Intranet](intranet.gov.uk), and
2) Your [MoJ Intranet](intranet.gov.uk) account meets the necessary permissions, as defined in that codebase.

Access points:

1) [All agencies](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/wp/wp-admin/)

Please get in touch with the [Intranet team on Slack](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C03QE40GVA6) for further 
information.

### Technical details of the accessing flow

1. A user logs into the Intranet.
2. The user clicks a link to the archive.
3. This submits a POST request to the archive NodeJS server.
   The payload contains an expiry and the users agency.
   The request is signed with a shared secret, and the server validates the signature.
4. The NodeJS responds by redirecting to the CloudFront distribution.
   The redirect URL contains cookies, so that the user can access the snapshot.

## Creating a snapshot

Access is granted if you are in possession of the basic-auth credentials.

Access point: [via Cloud Platform (dev)](https://dev-intranet-archive.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/)

## Local development

> It's important to note that creating a snapshot of the intranet from a local machine proved to present resource
> related issues, such as VPN timeouts and rate limiting. 

Requires

- Docker

### Installation

Clone to your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/ministryofjustice/intranet-archive.git && cd intranet-archive
```

Start docker compose:

```
make run
```
There is a script designed to help you install the [Dory Proxy](https://github.com/FreedomBen/dory), if you'd like to.

If you chose to install Dory, you can access the application here:

[spider.intranet.docker](http://spider.intranet.docker/)

Otherwise, access the application here:

[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

## Understanding application logic

Let's begin with servers and their interactions within... 

The Archiver has an Nginx server. This is used to display responses from the underlying NodeJS 
server where Node processes form requests and decides how to treat them. Essentially, if happy with the request, Node 
will instruct HTTrack to perform a website copy operation, and it does this with predefined options, and a custom plugin.

## HTTrack

At the very heart of the Archiver sits [HTTrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTrack). This application is configured 
by Node to take a snapshot of the MoJ Intranet. Potentially, you can point the Archiver at any website address and, 
using the settings for the Intranet, it will attempt to create an isolated copy of it.

### Debugging

The output of HTTrack can be noted in Docker Composes' `stdout` in the running terminal window however, a more 
detailed and linear output stream is available in the `hts-log.txt` file. You can find this in the root of the snapshot. 

### Custom commands

During the build of the Archiver, we came across many challenges, two of which almost prevented our proof of concept 
from succeeding. The first was an inability to display images. The second was an inability to download them.

**1) The HTTrack `srcset` problem**

In modern browsers, the `srcset` attribute is used to render a correctly sized image, for the device the image was loaded
in. This helps to manage bandwidth and save the user money. The trouble is HTTrack doesn't modify the URLs in `srcset` 
attributes so instead, we get no images where the attribute is used.

Using `srcset` in the Archive bears little value so to fix this we decided to remove `srcset` completely, we use
[HTTracks' `-V` option](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/httrack/httrack.1.en.html#V); this allows us to execute a command on every file that is downloaded. In particular, we run the 
following `sed` command, where `$0` is the file reference in HTTrack.

```bash
# find all occurrences of srcset in the file referenced by $0 
# select and remove, including contents.
 
sed -i 's/srcset="[^"]*"//g' $0
```

**2) The HTTrack `/agengy-switcher` problem**

We do not want the archiver to crawl the `/agency-switcher` page. This is because, the page is unnecessary in the context 
of browsing an agency's archived snapshot. 

We use a custom command to replace the agency switcher link on all pages, and replace it with a link to the root of the cdn domain.
This link to the root of the cdn domain will show the index page, and allow the user to navigate to the agency they want to view.

```bash
# find all occurrences of href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/agency-switcher/" in the file referenced by $0 
# and replace them with href="/".
 
sed -i 's|href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/agency-switcher/"|href="/"|g' $0
```

### Testing and making modifications to the application

All processing for HTTrack is managed in the `process.js` file located in the NodeJS application. You will find all the 
options used to set HTTrack up.

To understand the build process further, please look at the Makefile.

## Caveats

The Archiver currently runs an unprivileged image on Cloud Platform that isn't yet confgiured to run CRON jobs. This has meant that an automated script to synchronise a snapshot with the configured S3 bucket fails to run. In order to get the content from our application to S3, the command `s3sync` needs to be executed on the pod that is running the snapshot process.

It may be possible to 
[interact with running pods with help from this cheatsheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#interacting-with-running-pods).
Please be aware that with every call to the CP k8s cluster, you will need to provide the namespace, as shown below:

```bash
kubectl -n intranet-archive-dev
```

## Commands

**Kubernetes**
```bash
# list available pods for the namespace
kubectl -n intranet-archive-dev get pods

# copy a log file from a pod to your local machine 
# update pod-id, agency and date
kubectl -n intranet-archive-dev cp intranet-archive-dev-<pod-id>:/archiver/snapshots/intranet.justice.gov.uk/<agency>/<date>/hts-log.txt ~/hts-log.txt
```
